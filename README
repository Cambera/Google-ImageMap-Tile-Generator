Google Maps - Custom Image Map Type Generator
The following is a tool I developed to make generating custom ImageMapType Google Map's easy for all. It was inspired by a blog post I read from Mike Gleason where he shared his C#/.NET cmd line program that generated the tiles needed to create a custom Google Map. It was cool but I couldn't help myself take it online and make a web app out of the idea.
Once you've got the high resolution PNG image you'd like to use as a Google Map:
Select the appropriate zoom level. (it will depend on the resolution image you have)
Give it a name.
Upload the image from your computer.
Sit back and watch the magic..
Download your newly created tiles & html document that contains the html & js code you need to make use of a custom ImageType map.
